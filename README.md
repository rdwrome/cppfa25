### ALL DUE DATES ARE UNDER THE "ASSIGNMENTS" SECTION IN CANVAS

### Steps to submit assignments via GitHub+Canvas
  1. Make a subfolder in *your* GitHub repository (not the class respository!) named after the assignment (i.e. {yourusername}/{course}/{assignment}, etc.)
  2. Commit all parts of your assignment (i.e. code+documentation file) into that subfolder
  3. Submit the link **to that folder** in the appropriate Canvas assignment by the deadline

### Documentation File outline
  - The documentation file (**always *in* MarkDown, saved as a .md file**) must have the following:
    - what you did
    - how you did it
    - the problems you faced (ABDYDB: always be documenting your debugging!)
    - how you overcame them
    - *what code you used from others/elsewhere*
      - where to find that code (specific links!!!)
      - other folks' public GitHub repositories, [Stack OverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/), programming language forums are the best places to go for help most of the time
      - *do not* submit paywalled links
      - *if* you submit YouTube links (which is discouraged), they must have TIME STAMPS
    - Correctly document all your debugging, especially if you code ultimately does not run as intended. I will take points off for code that does not run correctly, but will still give partial credit if it is well-documented.
    - For the purposes of this class, your documentation file also helps you prepare to talk about your code in class with your colleagues.
    - In general (unless I specify otherwise), it is permissible to use chat-GPT or other large-language models under the following circumstances:
      - You document the **ENTIRE INTERACTION** with screenshots and include images of those screen shots with your documentation.
      - You write out *in your own words* your **SPECIFIC** understanding of what you learned from using chat-GPT in your documentation file.

## Policies
### Communication
- This is an equitable learning environment.
	- Use inclusive language.
	- Problem-solve constructively with respectful language;
	- Accept constructive criticism gracefully.
	- Be patient with yourselves and others (especially when mistakes are made);
	- Never posture/pose/attitudinize;
	- Always speak up and admit when you do not understand something.
	- Always try keep the needs of whole classroom community in mind.
- When you email me, please let me know what class/section you're in.
- The best way to communicate with me outside of class is *always* to make an appointment with me in my office hour.
- If you'd like constructive criticism on music, I'm happy to give that in my office hour in real-time. I won't give feedback on recordings via email.
- I don't answer emails that can be answered with a one-step Google search (i.e. “How do I change the timezone on my Google Calendar?”).
- I don't answer emails when the answer can be found in the syllabus (here).
- In an emergency, please call me (really).

### Grading
- The lowest progress report grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.
- Two assignment extensions may be granted more than 12 hours in advance, but will not necessarily be granted for large projects.
- Assignment extensions are not implicit with absences: if you are missing class the date something is due, you must explicitly ask for an assignment extension more than 12 hours in advance.
- You will be held to the Berklee Policy on Honesty in Academic Work (see Student Handbook).
- Late assignments (without granted extensions) are not accepted.
- If you have a question or comment about a grade, you must come ask it *in person* at my office hour.

### Attendance
- The lowest attendance grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.
- Remote attendance is not permitted.
- You must attend class with the computer you're using for class projects (no phones, no tablets, no borrowed laptops). If you do not, you'll receive a partial (50 %) attendance grade for the week.
- If you are more than 5 minutes late for class or leave more than 5 minutes early, you'll receive a partial attendance grade for the week.
- If you miss more than 30 minutes of class, you'll be marked absent.
- If you are disruptive in the class (talking, sleeping, using your laptop or phone beyond classwork) you'll receive one written warning and then receive a partial attendance grade if/when the disruptive behavior continues.
- When you are absent you are responsible for the materials of the class you missed. *I will not catch you up over email,* but you may come ask me questions during my office hour *after you have reviewed the materials.*
